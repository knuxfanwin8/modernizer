# modernizer - modern stylesheet for websites + extention
###Please note this is a very early version of the extention. 
###It is by no means stable and will glitch out on several websites.
###Especially new ones.

##How to use modernizer?

###Using the CSS stylesheet
1. Download the modernizer.css file from the repo. 
2. Refference the stylesheet in your website's code.
```
<head>
<link href="modernizer.css" rel="stylesheet"> 
</head>
```

or temporarily inject the CSS code via inspect element.

###Using the extention
The extention will be released once the final version of the stylesheet gets published.
