# Modernizer is no longer being developed.

No help will be offered. If you need a framework for your site, use Bootstrap.

# modernizer - modern stylesheet for websites + extention
Please note this is a very early version of the extention. 
It is by no means stable and will glitch out on several websites.

## How to use modernizer?

### Using the CSS stylesheet
1. Download the modernizer.css file from the repo. 
2. Refference the stylesheet in your website's code.
```
<head>
<link href="modernizer.css" rel="stylesheet"> 
</head>
```

or temporarily inject the CSS code via inspect element.

### Using the extention
You can use the early version of the modernizer extention.
1. Download the repo as a .zip archive.
2. Unpack the extention folder.
3. In Firefox, go to ``about:debugging``
4. Tick "Enable addon debugging"
5. Click on "Load temporary addon"
6. Navigate to the ``extention/firefox`` folder and pick manifest.json.
7. You can now use the extention until you restart.
